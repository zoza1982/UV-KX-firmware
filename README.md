# My fork of Quansheng UV-K5/K6/5R custom firmware

This repository is a fork of [Armel custom firmware](https://github.com/armel/uv-k5-firmware-custom)

## ..... Work in PROGRESS - not for everyday use .....

> [!WARNING]  
> To test this version you must bear in mind that it can corrupt the data in the EEPROM, so you must make a backup before using this version.
>
> **If you want to have a more stable FW and even with more features, I advise you to look at other options.**

> [!WARNING]  
> Use this firmware at your own risk (entirely). There is absolutely no guarantee that it will work in any way shape or form on your radio(s), it may even brick your radio(s), in which case, you'd need to buy another radio.

# UV-Kx Web tools
You can use [UV-Kx Web tools](https://home.joaquim.org/k5/) to manage your radio data (channels, settings, etc.) from your web browser. It works with Quansheng UV-K5/K6/5R and compatible custom firmwares (including this one).

# Open re-implementation of the Quansheng UV-K5/K6/5R v2.1.27 firmware

This repository is a fork of [Egzumer custom firmware](https://github.com/egzumer/uv-k5-firmware-custom), who was a merge of [OneOfEleven custom firmware](https://github.com/OneOfEleven/uv-k5-firmware-custom) with [fagci spectrum analizer](https://github.com/fagci/uv-k5-firmware-fagci-mod/tree/refactor) plus my few changes.

All is a cloned and customized version of DualTachyon's open firmware found [here](https://github.com/DualTachyon/uv-k5-firmware) ... a cool achievement !

> [!NOTE]
> EN - About Chirp, as many others firmwares, you need to use a dedicated driver available on [this repository](https://github.com/armel/uv-k5-chirp-driver). 
>
> _FR - A propos de Chirp, comme beaucoup d'autres firmwares, vous devez utiliser un pilote dédié disponible sur [ce dépôt](https://github.com/armel/uv-k5-chirp-driver)._

> [!WARNING]
> EN - THIS FIRMWARE HAS NO REAL BRAIN. PLEASE USE YOUR OWN. Use this firmware at your own risk (entirely). There is absolutely no guarantee that it will work in any way shape or form on your radio(s), it may even brick your radio(s), in which case, you'd need to buy another radio.
Anyway, have fun.

> _FR - CE FIRMWARE N'A PAS DE VÉRITABLE CERVEAU. VEUILLEZ UTILISER LE VÔTRE. Utilisez ce firmware à vos risques et périls. Il n'y a absolument aucune garantie qu'il fonctionnera d'une manière ou d'une autre sur votre (vos) radio(s), il peut même bousiller votre (vos) radio(s), dans ce cas, vous devrez acheter une autre radio. Quoi qu'il en soit, amusez-vous bien._

> [!CAUTION]
> EN - I recommend to backup your eeprom with [k5prog](https://home.joaquim.org/k5/) before playing with alternative firmwares. It's a good reflex to have.

 ## Manual

Up to date manual is available in the [Wiki section](https://github.com/armel/uv-k5-firmware-custom/wiki)

## Radio performance

Please note that the Quansheng UV-Kx radios are not professional quality transceivers, their
performance is strictly limited. The RX front end has no track-tuned band pass filtering
at all, and so are wide band/wide open to any and all signals over a large frequency range.

Using the radio in high intensity RF environments will most likely make reception anything but
easy (AM mode will suffer far more than FM ever will), the receiver simply doesn't have a
great dynamic range, which results in distorted AM audio with stronger RX'ed signals.
There is nothing more anyone can do in firmware/software to improve that, once the RX gain
adjustment I do (AM fix) reaches the hardwares limit, your AM RX audio will be all but
non-existent (just like Quansheng's firmware).
On the other hand, FM RX audio will/should be fine.

But, they are nice toys for the price, fun to play with.

## Compiler

arm-none-eabi GCC version 10.3.1 is recommended, which is the current version on Ubuntu 22.04.03 LTS.
Other versions may generate a flash file that is too big.
You can get an appropriate version from: https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/gnu-rm

clang may be used but isn't fully supported. Resulting binaries may also be bigger.
You can get it from: https://releases.llvm.org/download.html
